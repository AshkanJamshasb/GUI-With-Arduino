# GUI-With-Arduino
This took me a long while. Main purpose was to create a GUI with Eclipse and be able to use that GUI to communicate with an Arduino 
to change the color of the lights and to add a strobe effect. I did not include instructions for the breadboard layout, but by reading
the arduino code, one should be able to infer.
